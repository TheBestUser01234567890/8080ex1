8080/8085 CPU Exerciser
-----------------------

This is a fork of the [8080/8085 CPU Exerciser][]. The original exerciser
is written for the M80 assembler available for CP/M only. Within this project
the exerciser is changed to compile via [AS][] (asl), a portable macro 
assembler available on Linux, Windows and Mac.

The binary generated from the modified source is compared against the original
exerciser, and it matches entirely.

The source of this fork is based on the [Exerciser for KR580VM80A][].
